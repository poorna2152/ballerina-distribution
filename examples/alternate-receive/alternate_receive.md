# Alternate receive

The alternate receive action can be used to receive one of multiple values corresponding to multiple send actions. It operates by waiting until it receives a non-error message, a panic termination status on a closed channel, or the closure of all channels. The alternative receive action sets the first non-error value it receives as the result. If all the channels return errors, it sets the last received error as the result.
